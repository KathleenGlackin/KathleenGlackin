# Hi, I'm Kathleen! ðŸ‘‹

I've spent the past 7 years focusing primarily on custom WordPress theme development, with the occasional foray into other systems when the project called for it. Recently I've started broadening my horizons and delving into React, with my [portfolio site](https://kathleenglackin.com) serving as my inaugural project.

## About Me

I worked at an agency for 6 years and with a wide variety of clients, including the National Dog Show, the University of Pennsylvania, and Constellation. Currently I work at [PowerSchool](https://www.powerschool.com/) as a senior web developer and when I'm not in front of a computer I can be found building LEGO sets or putting together a jigsaw puzzle.
