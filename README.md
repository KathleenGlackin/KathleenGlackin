# Hi, I'm Kathleen! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve been developing custom WordPress themes since 2017, honing a strong foundation in coding functional, user-friendly sites. Recently, I've been broadening my skill set by exploring Astro and Tailwind CSS as well as building Discord bots.

## About Me

I worked at an agency for over 6 years and with a wide variety of clients, including the National Dog Show, the University of Pennsylvania, and Constellation. Currently I work at [PowerSchool](https://www.powerschool.com/) as a senior web developer and when I'm not in front of a computer I can be found (indoor) bouldering, building LEGO sets, or putting together a jigsaw puzzle.
