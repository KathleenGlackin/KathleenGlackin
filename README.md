# Hi, I'm Kathleen! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve been developing custom WordPress themes since 2017, with the occasional foray into other systems when the project called for it. Recently I've started broadening my skill set by exploring Astro and Tailwind CSS.

## About Me

I worked at an agency for 6 years and with a wide variety of clients, including the National Dog Show, the University of Pennsylvania, and Constellation. Currently I work at [PowerSchool](https://www.powerschool.com/) as a senior web developer and when I'm not in front of a computer I can be found building LEGO sets or putting together a jigsaw puzzle.
